#_module scss files
This directory holds the SMACS module files.

*_Modules_ are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.*

To learn more, I highy recommend reading [Jonathan Snook's SMACSS Book](https://smacss.com/)

###Note:###
For those that are using ReactJS, I recommend changing the name of this to 'components' to more align with the symantic intent of the styles. Since components should be narrowed down to a single reusable function or activity, the styles for that component would represent the _module styles.
