#_state scss files
This directory holds the SMACS state files.

*_State rules_ are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it ac- tive or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about de- scribing how a module might look in di erent views like the home page or the inside page.*
